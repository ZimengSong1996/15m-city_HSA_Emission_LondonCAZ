Abstract: Global cities are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with urban transportation being a primary source. Addressing these emissions is crucial for sustainable development. The "15-minute city" model seeks to transform urban areas into polycentric structures, reducing reliance on private vehicles by enhancing local accessibility and transforming urban spatial structures. This study develops a "human-scale accessibility" (HSA) indicator to evaluate the spatial efficiency of the 15-minute city concept at the street level. Utilizing data from street view images, points of interest (POIs), and spatial road networks, we focus on London's Central Activities Zone (CAZ) to assess the HSA's relationship with traffic emissions, car ownership, green commuting, health, and poverty. We use global and local regressions to build models of the relationship. Our findings indicate that while the 15-minute city concept does not directly reduce traffic emissions, it promotes green travel modes, challenging the assumption that it can effectively lower transport emissions. This research provides insights for urban planning and policy, highlighting the complex origins of metropolitan traffic emissions and supporting carbon reduction initiatives.
